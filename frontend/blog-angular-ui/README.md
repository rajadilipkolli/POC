## How to update the local angular-cli version

    npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
    npm i 
    ng update @angular/cli 
    ng update @angular/core

    if repository is not saved then use an `allow-dirty` flag to bypass the repo check.
    e.g ng update @angular/cli @angular/core --allow-dirty
	
	
	use npm outdated to check the available updates
	
	
## Update using npm-update-ckeck package 
 
This is a package available at npmjs.org , named npm-update-check, which works the same as npm update command. 
 
But the difference is that it's a utility that automatically adjusts packages which are listed into package.json file , whenever any updates are required. For that we need to install it via command: 
npm install -g npm-check-updates  
After installing the above package to a global location, now we will be able to update packages automatically. The next step is to update all the packages by running the command:
ncu -u // tells to update via npm package  
And then install it via npm install.
